# Two Sums

Given an array of integers __'nums'__ and an integer __target__ , return the 
_indices_ of the numbers such that they add up to the __target__ ie;

`	nums[i] + nums[j] == target // where i and j are the indices
`
### Example
`
	Input :
		nums = [2,7,11,15]
		target = 9
		twoSums(nums,target) 
	Output:
		[0,1] // nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
`
